                                                    <p>Note that "Violence" is activated on a 'per-damage' basis. If Lu Bu successfully Attacks another character with Wine (or if another 
                                                        character successfully Attacks Lu Bu with Wine), he will acquire two Rage Tokens. 
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>When Lu Bu loses health from "No Planning," he does not gain a Rage token. "Violence" is not activated when Lu Bu receives negligence damage. 
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>When Diao Chan activates "Sow Discord" on Lu Bu and forces the other character to play the first Attack, Lu Bu must choose to either discard 
                                                        one Rage Token or suffer one unit of negligence damage as per "No Planning."

                                                    <p>"Matchless" is the ability of normal Lu Bu. When Lu Bu targets another character with an Attack, the target must use an extra Escape (two 
                                                        instead of one) to avoid damage. Also, when Lu Bu participates in a Duel with another character, the target must use two Attacks per round instead of one.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>When Lu Bu activates "Unprecedented," he has "Matchless" for the rest of the turn. While he only makes one enemy's armor ineffective, "Matchless" goes into 
                                                        effect against any character Lu Bu chooses to target.

                                                    <p>When Lu Bu targets another character with "Unprecedented," the targets armor is ineffective with respect to all cards played, not just Attacks. For example,
                                                        if Lu Bu makes the Wood Armor ineffective, the target must play an Attack if Lu Bu plays Barbarians.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>When Lu Bu uses "Divine Anger," he draws one Rage Token for each player he damages.

                                                    <p>When Lu Bu activates "Divine Anger," the three effects go into effect in the order listed. Each player is affected in sequence, starting from Lu Bu's right.

                                                        <p>"Command to Endure" is activated on a 'per-damage' and 'per-card' basis. For example, if Sima Yi takes two units of damage in one instance, he gains two Endurance Tokens.

                                                        <p>Below is a list of the abilities that Sima Yi gains from "Promotion" and how he can use them:                                                        
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>1."Devil" - This is one of the normal Sima Yi's abilities. When a judgement card is flipped, Sima Yi can spend an Endurance Token and discard one of his hand cards. The hand card he discards is the judgement card that goes into effect.                                                         
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>2."Exile" - This is one of Cao Pi's abilities. When Sima Yi is damaged, he can spend an Endurance Token and select any character. This character flips their character card and draws X cards, X being the difference between Sima Yi's 
                                                            maximum and current health levels assessed after the damage is dealt. Note that "Command to Endure" is activated before this ability can be activated when Sima Yi is damaged. For example, if Sima Yi is dealt one unit of damage, 
                                                            he immediately acquires an Endurance Token then he can decide to use "Exile."                                                         
                                                        </p>  
                                                        <p>3."Complete Kill" - This is one of Jia Xu's abilities. During Sima Yi's turn, he can spend an Endurance Token. For the rest of this turn, only Sima Yi and characters on the brink of death can use Peach. In effect, this ability 
                                                            prevents players from being saved from the brink of death by teammates via the use of Peach. When Sima Yi spends an Endurance Token to use this ability, it lasts only for the current turn.                                                        
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>4."Reconsider" - This is Sun Quan's ability. Once during Sima Yi's turn, he can spend an Endurance Token and discard an number of his cards to draw the same number of cards from the deck. Note that Sima Yi can only use this power once per turn.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>5."Gathering Wisdom" - Is one of Huang Yue Ying's abilities. Whenever Sima Yi uses a tool card, he can discard an Endurance card to immediately draw a card. Note that Sima Yi does not have Huang Yue Ying's "Wondrous Talent" that allows her to 
                                                            bypass all range restrictions when she plays tool cards. In other words, unlike Huang Yue Ying, Sima Yi can only play Starvation and Steal within he physical range and cannot bypass this restriction.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>In most cases, "Breaking Links" is activated during Sima Yi's turns. If Sima Yi kills someone during his turn, he takes another turn immediately afterwards.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>Note that "Breaking Links" only gives Sima Yi one extra turn regardless of the number of players that Sima Yi kills during his turn. However, Sima Yi can have multiple turns in succession if he kills more players during the extra turns he gains from "Brinking Links."
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>If Sima Yi manages to kills somebody outside of his turn, he can choose to take a turn immediately after the current turn. After Sima Yi's turn from this ability, the person to Sima Yi's right takes their turn (assuming that Sima Yi did not kill 
                                                            anyone during this turn). This gives Sima Yi the potential to disrupt the normal turn order and essentially 'skip' other players' turns. However, this happens very rarely. It usually requires the use of Coerce or character abilities like Diao Chan's
                                                            "Sow Discord" or Xun Yu's "Rouse the Tiger."
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>If Sima Yi plays Lightning, kills a character in the same turn, then activates "Breaking Links," Sima Yi must flip a judgement card for the Lightning on his extra turn.
