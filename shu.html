                                                    are discarded. The same logic is applied for the use of Peach Garden. If another character plays the card, Xu Shu is not healed. If Xu Shu plays the card, he is the only character that has the

                                              <p>If Liao Hua plays Lightning in the extra action phase granted by "Vanguard," he must flip a judgement for this card during his judgement phase.

                                              <p>When a character is on the brink of death, everyone who is in play is prompted for a Peach to save the dying character. This process starts with the character who is taking their turn when the brink of death is reached and it goes to the right
                                                 around the table. Liao Hua must choose to activate "Aspiration" when it is his turn in this process. This means that he cannot wait to see if other characters to his right have a Peach before using his power.</p>
                                              <p>When "Aspiration" is activated, X is determined by how many countries are represented when Liao Hua activates the power on the brink of death, not by the number of countries that were represented at the beginning of the game. In other words,
                                                if all characters from a particular country are dead when "Aspiration" is activated, that country is not counted in X.</p>
                                              <p>When "Aspiration" is activated, note that Liao Hua does not regain X units of health, but he returns to a health level of X. In other words, if Liao Hua is Attacked with Wine when he has one unit of health, he still returns to a health level
                                                of X, not a health level of X - 1 as one might intuitively think.</p>

                                              </p>
                                              <p>1.For Attacks, Breaks, Steals, Blazes, and Duels, Jian Yong can target an additional person with any range. The first target must be within Jian Yong's attacking range however.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>2.For Peaches, Wines, and Draw Twos, Jian Yong enjoys the benefit of the used card then he selects any other player. They get the same benefit as Jian Yong does. This includes Wine, but will only come to fruition if Jian Yong uses a Coerce with
                                                that character on that turn.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>3.For Barbarians, Hail of Arrows, Peach Garden, and Harvest, Jian Yong can reduce the number of targets by one. During a Harvest, the number of cards turned over is not altered.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>4.For Coerce, Jian Yong targets one character with a weapon in their equipment area, and prompts them to attack another character. He then repeats this process with another character with a weapon in their equipment area.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>5.For Chains, Jian Yong chooses two characters to toggle their chain status. He can then choose to target a third character and as well or he can choose to not target one of the targets he initially chose when playing the Chains (though it is
                                                difficult to imagine a situation in which this second choice would be useful). If Jian Yong trades in the Chain, he cannot allow another character to draw a card and this does not count as the first card used during this turn.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>Note that when Jian Yong successfully activates "Persuade," he can only increase/decrease the number of targets of the first basic/tool card played. Even if he chooses not to increase/decrease the number of targets of the first basic/tool card used,
                                                he cannot choose to increase/decrease the number of targets of any subsequent basic/tool cards used for the rest of the turn.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>"Ignore Formalities" can be used in conjunction with the competition in used in "Persuade."

                                                <p>"Instigate" is one of Jiang Wei's abilities. It allows him to select a character that can reach him in their attack range and force them to play an Attack on him. If they do not, Xiahou Ba selects
                                                   one of their cards and forcibly discards it.</p>

                                                  select any character and attack them. There are no distance restrictions when using either option of this ability and both options can be used so long as Xiahou Ba has a piece of equipment to discard
                                                   for option two.</p>

                                                  health, he can use "Instigate" and "Roar."</p>
